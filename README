Easy pluggable malloc / free scaffolding

Usage
-----

Copy the src/easy-alloc.c and src/easy-alloc.h directly into your project.
Rename them and adjust them to fit in with your project's name conventions.

The "demo" directory shows an example usage, but in short the idea is for
the default to use the standard libc malloc and free, but to make it easy
to plug in a special allocator for test, thus allowing easier testing of
Out Of Memory.

In the code, rather than calling malloc and free directly, keep a function
pointer to the allocation and freeing functions, perhaps by adding them to
your struct:

	struct foo_s {
		easy_malloc_func alloc;
		easy_free_func free;
		void *mem_context;
		...
	};


	struct foo_s *foo_new_custom_allocator(easy_malloc_func ealloc,
	                                       easy_free_func efree,
	                                       void *mem_context)
	{
		if (!ealloc || !efree) {
			ealloc = easy_stdlib_malloc;
			efree = easy_stdlib_free;
			mem_context = NULL;
		}
		...
	}

	struct foo_s *foo_new(void)
	{
		return foo_new_custom_allocator(NULL, NULL, NULL);
	}

	void foo_bar(struct foo_s *foo, int bar)
	{
		char *buf = foo->alloc(foo->mem_context, BUF_LEN);
		...
	}
